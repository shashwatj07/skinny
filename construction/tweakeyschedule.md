# Tweakey Schedule
* The tweakey arrays are updated as follows (the tweakey schedule is illustrated and end of this page). First, a permutation PT is applied on the cells positions of all tweakey
arrays

* Every cell of the first and second rows of TK2 and TK3 (for the SKINNY versions where TK2 and TK3 are used) are individually updated with an LFSR

## You can look at Permutation and LFSR in detail in below links
